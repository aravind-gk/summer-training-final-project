# summer-training-final-project

The assignment is as follows: Given data of bank customers, we have to use predictive modeling to determine, for each customer, whether they will subscribe to term deposits in the bank. The full Problem statement is included in the repository.

I have approached the problem by first performing variable analysis on the datasets. First performed univariate analysis to understand each variable and it's distribution and then performed bivariate analysis to find patterns / correlation between variables that are likely to have correlation.

After splitting training dataset into training and validation data, I construct seperate models for both logistic regression and decision tree, and then test them against the given test dataset. I got close to 90% accuracy on test dataset on both regression and decision tree models.
